# Retail Sales Analysis Project

Welcome to the Retail Sales and Customer Demographics Dataset! This synthetic dataset has been meticulously crafted to simulate a dynamic retail environment, providing an ideal playground for those eager to sharpen their data analysis skills through exploratory data analysis (EDA). With a focus on retail sales and customer characteristics, this dataset invites you to unravel intricate patterns, draw insights, and gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior.

## Dataset Overview:

This dataset is a snapshot of a fictional retail landscape, capturing essential attributes that drive retail operations and customer interactions. It includes key details such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount. These attributes enable a multifaceted exploration of sales trends, demographic influences, and purchasing behaviors.

## Questions to Explore:

How does customer age and gender influence their purchasing behavior?

Are there discernible patterns in sales across different time periods?

Which product categories hold the highest appeal among customers?

What are the relationships between age, spending, and product preferences?

How do customers adapt their shopping habits during seasonal trends?

Are there distinct purchasing behaviors based on the number of items bought per transaction?

What insights can be gleaned from the distribution of product prices within each category?

## Introduction
Retail sales data analysis can reveal valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance. This project analyzes retail sales data to answer critical business questions and identify patterns that can drive strategic decisions.

## Data Understanding
In this section, we explore the dataset to understand its structure and content. We perform initial data inspections, including checking data types and identifying missing values.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial for accurate analysis. We perform several tasks to clean and prepare the data:

1. Add Month and Day columns: Convert the 'Date' column to datetime type.
2. Add Age Group: Categorize customers into age groups.
3. Add Month Quartiles: Divide months into quartiles.
4. Group Data: Aggregate data by categories and total amounts.
5. Add Season Column: Classify transactions by seasons.

## Data Visualization
We answer several business questions using visualizations to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
